Initial support for Fusion3 F410


Fusion3 does not openly support Cura as the slicer for their machine(s). These are the generic profiles for basic materials such as PLA, PETG, ABS, ASA, PC, PA, CPE and TPU.
The large majority of materials on the "Certified Materials" list, use these base generic files.


Please view https://www.fusion3design.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fusion3-Certified-Materials-List-updated-10.28.2020-Simplify3D.pdf
to identify which materials use a generic (F410-"nozzle size" - "material") type profile.


More profiles will be added at a later date.

This is a patch to add the Fusion3 F410 to Cura version 5.1.1. In order to properly apply this patch, please download the resources.zip file. Move this file to your desktop and extract it so the content of the folder is on your desktop, all residing in a single "resources" folder. Open Windows File Explorer and navigate to the default Ultimaker Cura directory. This should be C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 5.1.1

Drop the ENTIRE resources folder into the Ultimaker Cura directory. Be sure that you do not accidentally drop it into a sub-folder. Allow Windows to create and over-write the necessary files.

If Cura is open, close it and restart the program. Then simply add the Fusion3 F410 like you would with another other 3d printer.
